# Email-Spam-Classification-ML-Project
This project is to create a binary classifier that can distinguish spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails.

Here I ran through different features to find which is the best to filter out spam emails. 

These are the following tools I used for this project: 

- Using sklearn libraries to process data and fit models.
- Validating the performance of your model and minimizing overfitting.
- Generating and analyzing ROC curve.
